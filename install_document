Before install the openh323,the ptlib must be installed fist.
After that,when compile the openh323 with the version 2.10.10,
a compile error may occure,that "NatTypes" is not a type.
Then,what we must to do is that changing
#if PTLIB_MAJOR==2 && PTLIB_MINOR<10
to
#if PTLIB_MAJOR==2 && PTLIB_MINOR<=10
in include/openh323buildopts.h.in and include/openh323buildopts.h
solves the problem with PTLIB 2.10.10.

when coding,we must include the <ptlib.> first ,then the file <h323.h>.
if not ,we'll get the error "in channal.h:Pthread is not a type".
